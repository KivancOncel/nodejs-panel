# About the Project
This project is a Website Management Panel application that I developed using Node.js. This panel provides various tools for users to easily manage their websites. A robust server structure was built using Express.js, data management was handled with MongoDB, and dynamic HTML templates were created using EJS (Embedded JavaScript).

The project is continuously being developed, with a focus on enhancing functionality and creating user-friendly interfaces.

# Technologies Used
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web framework used to build web applications and APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A template engine used to generate HTML templates on the server side.
# Project Documentation
1. User Management
You can add, delete, and update users through this panel. Authorization mechanisms are applied based on user roles.
2. Content Management
You can manage the content of your website (such as blog posts, pages, etc.) through this panel. Using EJS, you can define how dynamic content is displayed.
3. Database Management
The system integrates with MongoDB, storing your data securely and in a scalable way. Custom management tools for CRUD operations have been developed.
# Developer Notes
This project was created to enhance my skills in developing web applications with Node.js and Express.js. I integrated key features such as data modeling with MongoDB, dynamic HTML templates with EJS, and user management. Throughout the development process, I followed best practices to ensure both performance and security.
